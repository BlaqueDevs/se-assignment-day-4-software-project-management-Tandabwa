## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages.
### **Waterfall Methodology**

**Overview:**
- **Linear and Sequential**: Waterfall is a traditional, linear approach where the project is divided into distinct phases: requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
- **Progress is Unidirectional**: Each phase must be completed before moving on to the next, with little room for revisiting previous stages.

**Advantages:**
1. **Clear Structure and Documentation**: Each phase is well-defined, with detailed documentation. This clarity is beneficial for new team members or for future maintenance.
2. **Predictable Timelines and Costs**: Since all requirements are defined upfront, it’s easier to estimate the time and cost for the entire project.
3. **Easy to Manage**: The straightforward, linear process is easier for project managers to oversee and track progress.

**Disadvantages:**
1. **Inflexibility**: Once a phase is completed, it’s difficult and costly to go back and make changes. This rigidity can be problematic if requirements change or issues are discovered later.
2. **Late Testing**: Testing occurs at the end of the development process, which means that any issues or bugs are discovered late, potentially leading to significant rework.
3. **Customer Involvement**: Customers typically only see the final product, with little involvement during the development process, which can lead to a product that doesn’t fully meet their needs.

### **Agile Methodology**

**Overview:**
- **Iterative and Incremental**: Agile is an iterative approach where the project is divided into small, manageable chunks called sprints or iterations. Each sprint results in a potentially shippable product increment.
- **Flexible and Adaptive**: Agile allows for continuous feedback, adaptation, and improvement throughout the project.

**Advantages:**
